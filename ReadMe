# Step 1
- Train YOLO with yolo_train.py for hand detection and segmentation

# Step 2
- Segment hands from video clips for each guitar techniques

# Step 3
- Extract optical flow from each video clips and store normalized motion vectors as histgrams of motion for corresponding direction

# Step 4
- Train Multi LeNet classifier to classify the techniques based on the histgrams
